# Getting Started with Your Ionic Project

This guide will walk you through the steps to set up and run your Ionic project on your local development environment. Please make sure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed before proceeding.

## Clone the Repository

1. Open your terminal.
2. Navigate to the directory where you want to store your project:
   ```shell
   cd /path/to/your/projects

   cd your-ionic-project
   npm install
